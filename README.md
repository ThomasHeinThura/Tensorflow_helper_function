# Tensorflow_helper_function
They are functions to help while doing deep learning with Tensorflow

The project is still progressing 
Need to do 
1. need to fix methods and commenting 
2. remove duplicated functions
3. mini-code for CNN and NLP
4. Need to clean code and test every function
5. separate the procedure to do and functions. Procedures are important because you can forget what to do.
