# Tensorflow_helper_functions
> They are functions to help while doing deep learning with Tensorflow
> each functions file contain 
    -> import data functions and procedures
    -> visualize data funcitons and procedures (there is alot to add)
    -> preprocess data and prepare data
    -> callbacks (this may be working only in tensorflow-keras api)
    -> visualize trained models and predictions.
> There is also procedures for creating basic and advance models 
> each models example contain
    -> creating procedures for basic example simple-models
    -> creating procedures for advanced example models
> Most of the codes can be copy and re-create whatever you need but some codes are fix with some models and data. Example : plot_models (which show models architecture) only work in jupyter notebook and google colbab.
> These functions are just examples to help and improve doing deep learning. It is like cheat code for easily search solutions before you go to search in google.
> It is not beginner friendly code but recommend to check the code.

The project is still progressing 
Need to do 
1. need to fix functions and commenting 
2. remove duplicated functions
3. Need to clean code and test every function
4. separate procedures and functions. Procedures are important because you can forget what to do. Check procedures are correct.
