# Tensorflow_helper_functions
* They are functions to help while doing deep learning with Tensorflow
* each functions file contains  
    -> import data functions and procedures  
    -> visualize data functions and procedures (there are a lot to add)  
    -> preprocess data and prepare data  
    -> callbacks (this may be working only in Tensorflow-Keras API)  
    -> visualize trained models and predictions.  
* There are also procedures for creating basic and advanced models 
* each models example contains  
    -> creating procedures for basic example simple-models  
    -> creating procedures for advanced example models  
* Most of the codes can be copied and re-created whatever you need but some codes are fixed with some models and data. Example: plot_models (which shows models architecture) only works in Jupyter notebook and google colbab.
* These functions are just examples to help and improve Deep-learning-coding. It is like a cheat code for easily searching solutions before you go to search in google.
* It is not beginner-friendly code but recommend to check the code.

The project is still progressing 
Need to do 
1. need to fix functions and commenting 
2. remove duplicated functions
3. Need to clean code and test every function
4. separate procedures and functions. Procedures are important because you can forget what to do. Check procedures are correct.
